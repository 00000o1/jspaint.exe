This is Microsoft's Paint, recreated in JavaScript as web app, then packaged into a binary to run "natively" on different platforms.

WARNING: If you do not like Google Chrome, do not use this app. We use Chrome to display the web app version of Paint, and if you don't have it installed we download and install it, so you will hate us if you don't like Chrome. Better to leave now.

CREDITS: 

- the mercurial 1j01/jspaint is the source of this Paint recreation. Bravo!
- And, Microsoft, too, I guess? For creating the original Paint, of course! Many fun days in my youth spent at your pixel.
