Welcome to 𝕊𝕙𝕒𝕣𝕙𝕒𝕣𝕞𝕚𝕤 𝔻𝕦𝕝𝕔𝕖 𝔻𝕪𝕟𝕒𝕞𝕚𝕔 𝕊𝕪𝕟𝕥𝕙!

Relive the 90s with our re-imagined version of Microsoft's classic Paint, now in web app form. Get ready for some serious nostalgia as you dive back into the world of BBS zines and pixelated art.

⚠️ Warning: If you're not a fan of Google Chrome, it's best if you don't use this app. We use Chrome to display the web app version of Paint, so if you don't have it installed, we'll download and install it for you. This may not be your cup of tea if you don't like Chrome.

🎉 Credits:

- The one and only 1j01/jspaint, source of our Paint recreation. Kudos!
- And of course, Microsoft, for creating the original Paint. So many childhood memories made at your pixels.

Download a Release:
- Builds available for:
- MacOS (tested on ARM / M1)
- Windows (x64 tested on Parallels on ARM)
- Linux (untested lately)
